Oct 9, 2009: OrthoMCL-DB Version 3 is available at <a href="http://beta.orthomcl.org">beta.orthomcl.org</a>.  Give it a try, and contact us at help@orthomcl.org with comments or problems.
Feb 28, 2008 : OrthoMCL-DB Version 2 is released.  The new dataset includes an increased number of genomes (87).  New features on the web site include a system wide speed up; a significant speed up of the phyletic pattern query; improvements in query pages and group pages to accomodate the increased number of genomes; and use of public identifiers for sequences throughout the site, instead of assigned identifiers.  Perhaps most importantly, the production of the dataset has been moved to a pipeline system.  This will allow us to generate new versions at a much improved frequency. For reference, <a href = "http://v1.orthomcl.org/">OrthoMCL-DB Version 1.0</a> is still online.
Apr 18, 2007 : OrthoMCL is one of the best evaluated in PLoS ONE 2(4): e383.
Apr 24, 2006 : We just recovered our OrthoMCL-DB server from a hack-in that happened a week ago.
Jan 18, 2006 : A new feature is added to the history function: group queries and sequence queries can be transformed to each other, which allows much more flexible queries (e.g. all protein kinases that have a specific phyletic pattern).
Jan 1, 2006 : The paper describing OrthoMCL-DB is published at Nucleic Acids Research. <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/suppl_1/D363">Link to the paper</a>. 
Sep 23, 2005 : We added interactive SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) graphs for BioLayout. By using this tool, you can navigate the sequence relationships within ortholog groups (group size <= 100): reciprocal best hits across species; reciprocal better hits within species; and other general edge relationships! Please forward any suggestion/bug report to help@orthomcl.org Thanks.
