            <p>Orthologs, as one type of homologs, are proteins which come from speciation events, as contrasted with 
    paralogs, another type of homologs, which derive from duplication events. Detection of orthologs is becoming
    much more important as the rapid progress in genome sequencing. 
            <p>OrthoMCL is a genome-scale algorithm for grouping ortholog protein sequences. It provides not only groups
    shared by two or more species/genomes, but also groups representing species-specific gene expansion families.
    So it serves as an important utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL starts from looking
    for reciprocal best hits within each genome as putative in-paralog/recent paralog pairs, reciprocal better hits
    across any two genomes as putative ortholog pairs. As a result, related proteins are interlinked in a similarity
    graph. Then MCL (Markov Clustering algorithm,Van Dongen 2000; http://micans.org/mcl/) was invoked to split 
    mega-clusters as an analogous process of manual review in COG construction. However, MCL clustering is based on
    weights between each pair of proteins, so to correct for differences in evolutionary distance the weights are 
    normalized before running MCL.
            <p>OrthoMCL performs similarly with the INPARANOID algorithm(Remm, Storm et al. 2001), but can be extended 
    to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO
    (Lee, Sultana et al. 2002), but the analysis using EC number suggests a high degree of reliability(Li, 
    Stoeckert et al. 2003). 
            <p>In a recent assessment (Chen, et al. 2007), the performance of seven widely used orthology detection algorithms, representing three kinds of strategies (phylogeny-based, evolutionary distance-based and BLAST-based), are evaluated using a statistical technique Latent Class Analysis (LCA). LCA is useful when there are large data sets available but no gold standard of truth. The results show a overall trade-off between sensitivity and specificity among these algorithms, with INPARANOID and OrthoMCL as two best methods having both False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) error rates lower than 20%.

          <p>OrthoMCL was originally designed as a database-based pipeline by Li Li: all the data used by OrthoMCL was 
    stored in the GUS relational database(Genomic Unified Schema; (Davidson, Crabtree et al. 2001)). Lots of MySQL
    queries were used to retrieve BLAST data. To satisfy the request to run ortholog clustering without depositing 
    data into GUS database, the Stand-alone version of OrthoMCL was developed as a stand-alone PERL package,
    which is available at <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/ORTHOMCL/">http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/ORTHOMCL/</a>.
          <p>Stand-alone OrthoMCL requires protein FASTA files for each genomes, and it calls for an all-against-all BLAST 
    analysis. Alternatively, OrthoMCL can start analysis by reading a BPO file (Blast Parsing Out) which describes 
    genes paired by BLAST matches, the E-value, and the identity percentage and the related HSP information.
          <p>As a perl package stand-alone OrthoMCL doesn't need compilation. However it requires some softwares and perl 
    modules to run: 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softwares:      1. BLAST (NCBI-BLAST, WU-BLAST, etc.)
                2. MCL (Markov Clustering algorithm), available at <a href="http://micans.org/mcl/">http://micans.org/mcl/</a>;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perl Modules:   1. Bio::SearchIO (part of BioPerl, <a href="http://bioperl.org">http://bioperl.org</a>)

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1. What group information are provided?</i>
          <p>For each ortholog group, we provide basic information and other useful data about the group:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i>. Size of the group, in terms of both #sequences and #taxa.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b)</i>. Sequence similarity info, indicating the conserveness of the group: % Match Pairs (percentage of all possible pairs within the group that are matched through BLAST under the default cutoff, and the rest of similarity info is calculated based on these matched pairs only), Average E-value, Average % Coverage, and Average % Identity.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c)</i>. Phyletic profile, displaying #sequences from each species that belong to this ortholog group; black box indicates presence (with the number below the genome abbreviation representing #sequences) while white box stands for absence.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d)</i>. Keywords: the most frequently occurring keywords in the annotations of the member sequences.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>e)</i>. Pfam domains: the most frequently occurring Pfam domains in the member sequences.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>f)</i>. Pfam domain architecture: useful to compare among group members and to identify outliers (due to evolution or sequencing/gene model errors).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>e)</i>. BioLayout graph, displaying the sequence similarity relationship between group members together with OrthoMCL edge information (in the SVG version of the graph).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>f)</i>. Multiple Sequence Alignment of the ortholog group.
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. Which softwares were used to generate MSA (multiple sequence alignment) and BioLayout graph?</i>
          <p>MUSCLE (3.52), and a special version of BioLayout (from Leon Goldovsky, EBI) which can generate PNG figures.
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3. Why some groups don't have links to MSA (multiple sequence alignment) or BioLayout graph?</i>
          <p>For big groups (size>100), we don't provide them because there are difficulties running MSA and BioLayout softwares for big groups. However, you can still download fasta sequences from our database and run alignment by yourself. As for BioLayout graph, you can contact us at OrthoMCL@pcbi.upenn.edu to request for BioLayout input files.
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>4. How can I find all E. coli genes which have human orthologs?</i>
          <p>OrthoMCL-DB is designed to provide complicated query features. In this case, several steps are required to find out the answer:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Step a)</i>. Identify the groups that satisfy this phyletic pattern criteria, using "eco+hsa=2T" at <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi?rm=groupQueryForm&type=ppexpression">Phyletic Pattern Expression (PPE) Group Query page</a> (eco and hsa are the abbreviation names for E. coli and H. sapiens).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Step b)</i>. Identify all genes belong to the groups identified in Step a, by selecting the group query result from Step a and clicking on "GROUP QUERY INTO SEQUENCE QUERY" at <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi?rm=groupQueryHistory">Group Query History page</a>. This will automatically redirect you to the Sequence Query History page, where all genes belong to the groups identified in Step a are deposited as a new sequence query.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Step c)</i>. Identify all E. coli genes, by searching "eco" in "Taxon_Abbreviation" at <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi?rm=sequenceQueryForm&type=ackeyword">Accession/Keyword Sequence Query page</a>.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Step d)</i>. Find out the answer to the original question by merging the sequence query results from Steps c and d using INTERSECTION at <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi?rm=sequenceQueryHistory">Sequence Query History page</a>. You can further download the list of gene IDs or sequences from this page.
