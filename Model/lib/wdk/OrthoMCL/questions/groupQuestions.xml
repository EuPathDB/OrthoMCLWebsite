    A question is "a query that returns a list of records."  (Regular queries 
    return columns and rows.)  They are formed by pairing a query with a
    record class.  The query must be one that returns one column containing
    a list of primary keys.  The record class must be one that expects as
    a primary key the type of key returned by the query.
    
    A question set is a grouping of questions.  It may be used in the
    user interface to present the enclosed questions in one choice box.

<p>Find Orthologous groups by the Phyletic pattern.</p>

<p>Phyletic Pattern Expression is a flexible way to do queries of ortholog groups. By using this tool, you can specify the presence or absence of genome (i.e. whether this genome has certain gene or not), and the number of copies (i.e. how many duplicates certain gene has in a specific genome).</p>

<p>*PPE Grammar: Individual grammatical units of PPE expressions are composed of two parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li> A species specification, composed of a three-letter species abbreviation (e.g. "tgon"), or a list of species abbreviations linked by plus sign "+" (e.g. "tgon+pfal+hsap"). Several abbreviations are also permitted, such as "BACT" for all Eubacteria genomes, "EUKA" for all eukaryotic genomes, "APIC" for all apicomplexan genomes, "ALL" to represent all the genomes in the current OrthoMCL (clade abbreviations are indicated on the form).</li>
	<li> A logical comparison operator, such as >, <, =, >=, or <=, and a number representing the number of sequences from these species that must be present in the ortholog group (e.g. "tgon>5" specifies ortholog groups containing at least 5 in-paralogs from Toxoplasma gondii. Alternatively, when appended with the character "T" (for Taxa), this number represents the number of species that must be represented in the ortholog group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple expression units may be combined using "AND" or "OR", and may use parentheses to provide explicit execution ordering.</p>

<p>Examples & Explanations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"hsap+ecol=2T" would generate ortholog groups in which both human and E. coli are present.</li>
    <li>"hsap+ecol=1T" would generate ortholog groups in which only one species of human and E. coli is present.</li>
    <li>"ALL=150T" would generate ortholog groups representing all 150 species.</li>
    <li>"EUKA=35T" would generate Eukaryota-universal ortholog groups (representing all 35 eukaryotic species).</li>
    <li>"EUKA>=5T AND hsap>=10" would generate all ortholog groups representing at least five eukaryotic species and containing at least 10 human proteins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Please prevent redundancy in your PPE query, e.g. "hsap>=1" is equal to "hsap=1T", so no need to mention them twice.</li>
    <li> Please merge different PPE units to save time in query, e.g. "hsap=1T AND mmus=1T" can be merged as "hsap+mmus=2T".</li>
</ul>
