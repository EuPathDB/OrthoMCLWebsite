    <!-- 
    A question is "a query that returns a list of records."  (Regular queries 
    return columns and rows.)  They are formed by pairing a query with a
    record class.  The query must be one that returns one column containing
    a list of primary keys.  The record class must be one that expects as
    a primary key the type of key returned by the query.
    
    A question set is a grouping of questions.  It may be used in the
    user interface to present the enclosed questions in one choice box.
